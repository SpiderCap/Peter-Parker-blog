        <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ! Not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. There are quite a few things I like about this film so this review may take a while to read.

Firstly, the Russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the MCU and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film’s plot. It seems that many of the MCU’s best films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit.

Compared to many MCU films, the acting in this film is phenomenal. Everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature. Shout out to Jeremy Renner, who portrays Clint Barton/Hawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and I’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments.</p>

      <p>With The Lion King being my favorite animated Disney movie, I’ve watched it many times as a kid, as an adult and shared it with my kids. 

I’m not sure what people mean when they say it lacks heart? Yes it’s the same story, same scenes etc. but it’s a remade version, which you can tell Disney was very careful with. When Alice in Wonderland came out, I was hoping and excited for The Lion King. More live action movies released and I know it was only a matter of time. 

This movie is fantastic. Not since Avatar have I been blown away by the visuals. Disney did such a good job on the animations, the animals move realistically, they look realistic and if animals could talk, this is how they would look while talking. A lot of people are hating on this movie to be part of the crowd, I give this 5 stars because the story wasn’t changed, the CG is seriously mind blowing, the soundtrack was done in justice, it’s darker than the animated original and it was pretty action filled. 

I feel this movie benefits from its live action. Scar looks more menacing, and you do get emotional and a heart warming sensation when watching because you see how an animal would actually look like when happy or sad. Maybe the negative reviews were from people who don’t have any pets?

This is a must watch, and sits next to some of the best movies I’ve ever seen.</p>

      <p>At first, going into the theater, I was wary due to the trailer, but this movie proved to be an epic sequel to the story of a powerful witch who needed to find where she belonged. Finally, Elsa has found where she belongs.

Into the first hour or so, I was convinced this was just another epic journey for Elsa, leaving Anna to trail behind. However, it twisted when Anna was tasked with saving not only her sister but her entire kingdom. I absolutely love the mythology in this and the sad history we learned about how their parents truly died. Plus, new characters and new songs were definitely a treat! Kristoff's solo ft. Sven and the other reindeer were a GREAT humor break while also providing more into his character.

Olaf's and Elsa's "deaths" were very tragic while also still being kid-friendly. While Olaf's little random facts and deep monologues can come off as irrelevant, the information he provided actually saved his life and brought balance back to their world. "Water holds memories".

Not only was the soundtrack epic and chilling, but the artwork was also just beautiful. I love the new world they created with their art and storytelling, as well as the new culture we, the audience, as well as the protagonists, get to see and enjoy.

I can't explain how much I LOVE this movie. I actually prefer it over the first movie. The whole character v. nature is BEAUTIFULLY shown, especially because I feel that element can be hard to show, especially in a children's movie. But everyone who worked on the movie did a wonderful job.</p>
